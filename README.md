Analysis on Spotify's top 200 charts for the year 2021 for region USA.

This is a personal project to analyze the paramters that drive music Tracks to be on the weekly Top 200 Spotify list. 

I performed web scraping to extract the Weekly top 200 list for all weeks in 2021 year for the USA region. This list was further used to pull the audio features of each music track. Audio features consists of many metrics describing a music track like danceability, tempo, etc.

Next steps: Preliminary analysis on the data and correlation analysis between the audio features and popularity of the music track.
